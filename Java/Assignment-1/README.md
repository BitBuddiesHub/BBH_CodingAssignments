# Assignment: Java Basics Exploration

## Objective

Develop a Java application that demonstrates an understanding of Java basics including classes, objects, methods, instance variables, and enumerations.

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1: Creating a Simple Java Program
- Develop a Java program that prints "Hello, Java World!" to the console in the `Main.java` file.
- Understand and explain the structure of a Java program, including the `main` method.

### Part 2: Exploring Classes and Objects
- In `Book.java`, create a class representing a simple object like a `Book`.
- Define at least two instance variables (e.g., `title` and `author`) and initialize them in a constructor.
- Implement a method that displays information about the book.

### Part 3: Methods and Instance Variables
- Add simple method stubs in the `Book` class to simulate various actions (like `readBook()`), without implementing detailed functionalities.
- Experiment with different access modifiers for methods and instance variables.

### Part 4: Using Enumerations
- In `FreshJuice.java`, define an enumeration (`enum`) representing juice sizes.
- Create a class `FreshJuice` with a variable to hold the size of the juice.

## Example Output

### Part 1 Output
```
Hello, Java World!
```

### Part 2 Output
```
(Book: Information display method is a stub)
```

### Part 3 Output
```
(Methods are stubs with no detailed output)
```

### Part 4 Output
```
(Enumeration used in FreshJuice class, but specific integration not implemented yet)
```


## Instructions

1. **Develop the Java Program (Part 1)**
   - Write a simple Java program with a main method that prints "Hello, Java World!".
   - Ensure the program compiles and runs successfully.

2. **Implement Classes and Objects (Part 2)**
   - Design a class for your chosen object with at least two instance variables.
   - Implement a method to display the object's details.

3. **Expand with Methods and Modifiers (Part 3)**
   - Add additional methods demonstrating various functionalities.
   - Experiment with different access modifiers for methods and variables.

4. **Incorporate Enumerations (Part 4)**
   - Define an `enum` related to your class.
   - Integrate the `enum` in your class to enhance its functionality.

## Submission

Submit your assignment by committing your Java files to your designated repository. Ensure your code is well-commented, explaining the functionality and the concepts demonstrated.


This assignment is designed to cover the foundational aspects of Java. It progresses from basic programming structures to more complex concepts like enumerations, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of Java essentials.
