# Assignment 4: Python Conditional Control

## Objective
In Python, conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on the outcome of a condition (True or False). This assignment will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Python conditionals, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. You will be practicing writing different conditional structures to understand how Python makes decisions based on given conditions.

## Task Description

### Task 1: Basic `if` Statements
Write a Python script that:
- Asks the user for an integer input.
- Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Prints an appropriate message based on the input value.

### Task 2: Using `elif` and `else`
Expand the script from Task 1 to:
- Check additional conditions (e.g., if the number is even or odd).
- Use `elif` to add these new conditions.
- Use `else` to handle cases that don't meet any of the specified conditions.

### Task 3: Nested `if` Statements
Create a script that:
- Asks the user for their age.
- Checks if they are a teenager (age between 13 and 19).
- If they are a teenager, use a nested `if` statement to check if they are 18 or older.
- Print appropriate messages for each condition.

### Task 4: The `range()` Function with `if`
Write a script that:
- Iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
- Uses an `if` statement inside the loop to print "Even" if the number is even, and "Odd" if the number is odd.

### Task 5: `if` Statements with Lists
Create a script that:
- Defines a list of colors (e.g., `['red', 'green', 'blue']`).
- Asks the user to input a color.
- Checks if the entered color is in the list and prints an appropriate message.

### Task 6: `break` and `continue` in Loops
- Write a script with a loop that counts from 1 to 20.
- Use `break` to exit the loop if the count reaches 10.
- Use `continue` to skip the number 5 and continue with the next iteration.

### Task 7: `for...else` Structure
Demonstrate the use of `for...else` by:
- Writing a script that searches for a specific number (e.g., 7) in a list of numbers.
- Use `for` loop to iterate through the list.
- Use `else` to print a message if the number is not found.

## Submission
Submit a `.py` file containing the scripts for each task. Make sure your code is well-commented, explaining each part of the conditional structures you have used.
