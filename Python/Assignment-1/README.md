# Assignment 1: Self-Introduction Script

## Objective

Create a Python script that prompts the user to enter various types of data, such as name, age, and city. Then, use different string formatting methods to generate a text introducing themselves.

## Requirements

  - City
- Use at least two different string formatting methods to create the introduction text.

## Example Output

```
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 25
Enter your city: New York

Introduction 1: Hello! My name is Alice, I am 25 years old and I live in New York.
Introduction 2: Hi! I'm Alice, a 25-year-old living in New York.
```
