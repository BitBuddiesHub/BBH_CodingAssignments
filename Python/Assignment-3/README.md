# Assignment 3: Python Error and Exception Handling

## Objective
In this assignment, you will delve into Python's error and exception handling mechanisms. As a Python beginner, encountering errors and exceptions is common. Understanding how to properly handle these situations is crucial for programming. You will learn about syntax errors, exceptions, the assert statement, and how to manage these issues using try/except blocks.

## Task Description
Your task is to create a Python script that demonstrates handling of different types of errors and exceptions. Specifically, your script should:

1. **Syntax Error Demonstration**: 
   - Write a piece of code that intentionally causes a syntax error.
   - Comment on why the error occurs.

2. **Exception Handling**: 
   - Write a code block that handles at least two different types of exceptions.
   - Use try/except blocks and print an appropriate message for each exception.

3. **Assertion**:
   - Use the assert statement to validate input or a condition.
   - Catch the AssertionError and print a response.

4. **Custom Error Creation**:
   - Create a custom exception class.
   - Demonstrate raising this exception in your code and handling it.

5. **Finally Block Usage**:
   - Implement a try/except block with a finally clause.
   - Show how finally is always executed, regardless of an exception being raised or not.

6. **File Handling with Exceptions**:
   - Write a code segment that opens a file and prints its contents.
   - Use exception handling to catch and print error messages for FileNotFoundError and any other potential exceptions.

7. **Clean-up Actions**:
   - Demonstrate the use of `with` statement for safe file handling, ensuring the file is closed after its content is processed.

## Requirements
- Ensure each task is well-commented to explain the purpose and functionality.
- Include at least one example of custom error messages.
- Your code should follow proper Python syntax and adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.

## Submission
Submit a Python script named `error_exception_handling.py`. Before submitting, test your script to ensure it runs as expected without any unintended errors.
