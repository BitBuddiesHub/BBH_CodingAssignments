# BBH_CodingAssignments

Welcome to the `BBH_CodingAssignments` repository! This is a dedicated space for members of the BitBuddiesHub (BBH) programming study group to collaborate on, submit, and review coding assignments. Our goal is to foster a learning environment where we can grow together as programmers.

## About BitBuddiesHub

BitBuddiesHub is a group of enthusiastic learners who are passionate about coding and technology. We believe in learning by doing and in the power of collaboration. This repository is a part of our effort to encourage active learning through practical assignments.

## Assignments Structure

Each assignment is located in its own directory within this repository. The directory structure is as follows:

- `/Assignment-1` - [Assignment 1 Title]
- `/Assignment-2` - [Assignment 2 Title]
- ... (and so on)

Within each assignment directory, you will find the following:

- `README.md` - Contains the assignment description, objectives, and any necessary instructions.
- `src/` - This folder contains the starter code (if any) and is where you should commit your solution.
- `test/` - Contains any test scripts or files to validate your solution.

Each student should create their own subdirectory within the assignment folder following this naming convention: `/<Assignment-N>/<YourGitHubUsername>`. For example, if your GitHub username is `alice`, and you are working on Assignment 1, create a directory named `/Assignment-1/alice`.

## How to Use This Repository

   ```
   cd Assignment-1
   ```
    2.5 **Create Your Directory**: Inside the assignment directory, create your own subdirectory using your GitHub username. If it already exists (from a previous pull), just use the existing one.

    ```bash
    mkdir YourGitHubUsername
    cd YourGitHubUsername
    ```

3. **Read Instructions**: Open the `README.md` file in the assignment directory to understand the requirements.

4. **Code**: Write your code in the `src/` directory.

5. **Test Your Solution**: Use the provided test scripts or files in the `test/` directory to test your solution.

6. **Commit and Push**: Once you are satisfied with your solution, commit your changes and push them to the repository.
